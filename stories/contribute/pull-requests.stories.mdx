# Pull requests

## Creating Pull Requests

Commits are very much at the code-level, and should be about the code changes. A pull request, on the other hand, though it's code-focused, requires a higher-level, architectural understanding of the change. A high-level summary and understanding of the problem is very useful for people looking back through a repo’s history in addition to reading the details of the individual code changes.

- Try keep PRs small (speeds up review, motivates and helps reviewer see what's changed)
- No more than 1 Jira issue pr pull request
- A PR can contain more than 1 commit
- Make sure to update version number in `package.json` if needed.
- Write useful titles and descriptions
- Add image(s) to show UI changes

## Reviewing Pull Requests

- Provide constructive feedback
  - Think of the person while writing comments.
    - Example comment:  
      `I suggest we use flex instead, so we can have a shorter and more consise way to arrange our list`  
       is better than ->  
       `This is just wrong. Why don't you use flex instead?!`  
       ;)
  - Possitive feedback is welcome as well
- Be precise about what you think needs to be improved
- Be strict about temporary code
  - Add comment with link to Jira task explaining the temporary code, so it will not be forgotten
- Try review pull request and answere comments as fast as possible

**Tip** for reviewer, ask yourself these questions:

- Will this change benefit the project in terms of maintenance?
- Will we have to change it because it’s just not scalable?
- Will we be able to read this code six months from now?

## Merging Pull Requests

- Minor and patch (1.x.x) releases requires 1 approval (other than yourself).
- Major (x.0.0) releases requires 2 or more approvals.
