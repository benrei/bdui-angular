## Branches

### Types

Name branches based on these types. This will help others get an idea of what the branch is about and could be used for automation

| Type    | Example                            | Description     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| bugfix  | bugfix/#xxx_Some_text_to_describe  | Bug fixes       |
| feature | feature/#xxx_Some_text_to_describe | Feature related |
| hotfix  | hotfix/#xxx_Some_text_to_describe  | Hotfixes        |
| patch   | patch/#xxx_Some_text_to_describe   | Patches         |
| release | release/#xxx_Some_text_to_describe | Releases        |
|         |                                    |                 |

## Commit messages

### Defining a commit message

```
type: <subject>
<body>
```

**Tip:** A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:

If applied, this commit will... `<your subject line here>`

**Example:** `DWC-1234 Add dropdown editor and stories`

### 1. Type of commit

| Type     | Example             | Description                                    |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| #xxx     | #xxx: "message"     | Github task (feature, bug, etc)                |
| chore    | chore: "message"    | Simple code maintenance                        |
| docs     | docs: "message"     | Everything related to documentation            |
| refactor | refactor: "message" | Refactoring a specific section of the codebase |

### 2. Subject

Short description of the applied changes.

- Short (72 chars or less)
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
  - Use "add user view" instaed of "added user view" or "adds user view"

```text
#xxx: add customer page
chore: remove unused user delete button
docs: update checkbox docs
```

### 3. Body (Optional)

Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.

- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Limit each line to 72 characters
- Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it
- Do not think your code is self-explanatory
